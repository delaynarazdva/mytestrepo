http://jsforcats.com/ is an introductory tutorial, covering the absolute basics. If you are completely new to programming, you might want to try this first (I hope you like cats though).
https://javascript.info/at javascript.info is an online book that, just like my tutorial, includes the option to directly try and tinker with the code samples. It also includes lots of excercises with accompanying sample solutions. It’s an easy to follow, but at the same time very complete tutorial. It’s a great read if you already have some programming experience and want to deepen your knowledge.
https://eloquentjavascript.net/ is more of a complete introduction to programming, that happens to use JavaScript as an example. It’s a bit slow and verbose though. To get started quickly, you might prefer another tutorial.
